# Rob-Arm-Tutorials: Review
Here are some brief notes that serve as a summary and shortcut for putting the Interbotix X-series robotic arms into use. In our case we will use the [WidowX 250 (6DOF) model](https://www.trossenrobotics.com/widowx-250-robot-arm-6dof.aspx#documentation).

The tutorials come from [this Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9EXEgzbAxQ&list=PL8X3t2QTE54sMTCF59t0pTFXgAmdf0Y9t&ab_channel=TrossenRobotics) (many thanks to Interbotix and all credit for them)
